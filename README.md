## Data Science Assignments

This repository contains a collection of notebooks and projects aimed at exploring various aspects of data science. Each notebook and project focuses on different tools and techniques commonly used in the field of data science.

### Notebooks:

1. **NumPy Notebook**:
   - This notebook explores the fundamentals of NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
   - It covers topics such as array creation, manipulation, indexing, and basic mathematical operations.

2. **Data Visualizations Notebook**:
   - Here, various data visualization techniques are demonstrated using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - The notebook showcases how to create plots, charts, and graphs to effectively visualize data distributions, trends, and relationships.

3. **Pandas Notebook**:
   - This notebook delves into Pandas, a versatile library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
   - It demonstrates how to load, clean, transform, and analyze data using Pandas data structures and functions.

4. **Core Python Codes Notebook**:
   - In this notebook, fundamental Python programming concepts are explored and applied to data science tasks.
   - It covers topics such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and data structures like lists and dictionaries.

5. **Scikit-learn Notebook**:
   - Scikit-learn is a widely-used machine learning library in Python, and this notebook provides an introduction to its key 
     functionalities.
   - It includes examples of various machine learning algorithms, such as regression, classification, and clustering, using Scikit-learn.
6. **Pickling**:
   - Pickling is the process of converting Python objects into byte streams, allowing them to be serialized and saved to disk. Scikit- 
     learn models can be pickled using Python's built-in pickle module.
   - Pickled models can be easily stored and later loaded into memory for inference.
7.**Joblib**:
   - Joblib is an alternative to pickle, optimized for serialization of large NumPy arrays.
   - It's particularly useful when working with Scikit-learn models that involve substantial data preprocessing steps or contain large 
     arrays.
7. **Flask**:
   - Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that can be used to create web applications, including APIs for model deployment.
   - This section demonstrates how to deploy a Scikit-learn model using Flask, allowing users to make predictions through HTTP requests.
  
### Projects:

1. **HR Data Analysis Project in Tableau**:
   - This project involves analyzing HR (human resources) data using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool.
   - The project explores various aspects of employee data, such as attrition rates, performance metrics, and employee demographics, to derive actionable insights for HR decision-making.

Each notebook and project is designed to provide hands-on experience with different tools and techniques commonly used by data scientists. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, these resources aim to enhance your skills and understanding in the field of data science.

The dashboard in the image  uses the following HR metrics:

Employee count: The total number of employees currently employed by the company.
Employee left: The number of employees who have left the company within a specific timeframe.
Attrition rate: A percentage calculated by dividing the number of employees who left the company during a specific timeframe by the average number of employees during that timeframe.
Active employees: The number of currently employed minus the number who left during a specific timeframe.
Average age: The average age of all employees.
Department wise attrition: The number of employees who left the company by department.
No. of Employee by Age Group: The number of employees categorized by age group.
Age Gap: The difference between the highest and lowest age groups.
Job satisfaction rating: The average rating employees gave regarding job satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5.
Education field wise attrition: The number of employees who left the company by their field of education.
Attrition Rate By Gender For Different Age Group: The attrition rate for male and female employees in different age groups.
HR professionals can use HR analytics dashboards to identify trends and patterns in their workforce data. This information can be used to improve a variety of HR initiatives, including recruitment, retention, training, and development. For example, an HR professional might use an HR analytics dashboard to see if there is a correlation between low job satisfaction ratings and high attrition rates. If they see a correlation, they can then investigate the reasons for the low job satisfaction ratings and develop programs to address them.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and projects, and don't hesitate to provide feedback or suggestions for improvement!
